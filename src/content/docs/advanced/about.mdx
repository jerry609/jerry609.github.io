<Aside title='Contributing Guide'>
Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make. You'd better make an issue first to discuss what you would like to change, which can avoid unnecessary work, especially when you want to make breaking changes.

All changes for `astro-pure` package should enable [Customize Theme#Package Mode](/docs/advanced/customize#package-mode) first. PR test will also run in that mode. This requests you test your changes locally using `bun run yijiansilian` command first.

And for contributing docs, you can simply click the "Edit on GitHub" link at the bottom of each doc page to change the docs content.
